Clean Code License

The Clean Code License (CCL) is based on the concept of typographical licenses. In short, you, the licensee,
is granted the rights to copy and modify the code, as long as your changes and the code you copy parts or all
from this project to, adheres completely to the typographical rules given by the source code from this project.

There are no explicit typographical rules specified by the project but, the rules are intrinsically given
by how the code is written. The licensee looses all rights for reusing all or parts of the code, if he chooses
to typographically modify the code or embeds code snippets from this project into code which does not adhere to
the typographic rules from this project.

Background: Various deviations from the typographic rules to lay out source code in different programming languages
are in use. Though some of them have their well founded origins, others evolved purely out of malice. We therefore
distinguish between Human Readable Code (HRC) and Machine Readable Code (MRC), sometimes also referred to as
Monkey Readable Code. As we are humans, we prefer HRC on should think. Knowing that, and taking advantage of
our human weaknesses, some programmers came up with totally screwed up coding conventions, which they sarcastically
refer to as clean code. Once such a screwed up coding convention can be implemented in a software development team,
it is easy to take over any project and kick out those programmers who do it right. The typographic license is
designed to prevent this from happening.
